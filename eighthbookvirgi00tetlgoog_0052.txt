noras 35

three of which (vv. 41, 4ῥ9, 536) occur in the present book. Although
the pauses produced Ι] these unfinished verses are often significant,
bringing a period to an effective close or marking a transition‚ it is
not to be supposed that Vergil intended to leave these verses in-
complete. If he had lived to give the final touches to the poem,
these gaps would undoubtedly have been closed.

42. vana haec fingere somnum: that these are the delusive sug-
gestions os slcep. Iam tibi inventa iacebit: you shall straightway
find lying.

45. Note the importance given to the color by the emphatic posi-
tion οἱ alba and albi, the one at the beginning of the verse, the
other aiter the caesural pause.

46. urbis: Lavinium, to be named from Aeneas’s future wife
Lavinia, daughter oi Latinus.

43-6. These verses are identical with 111. 390-3, except that in
the present passage we have hic locus urbis erit in place of is locus
urbis erit. In the third book the words occur in a' prediction of
the prophet Helenus, who is telling Aeneas where he isto build his
city 3 and the portent of the white sow and her thirty young is there

Α left uninterpreted. The identity oi the language in the present
passage serves to recall Helenus’s prediction, and to convince

Aeneas that he is not dreaming, but is in the personal presence of
the river god.

Sus alba, as appears from vv. 47—8‚ prefigures the city of Alba,
which, according to the legend, derived its name from the white
sow, though in reality probably from the color of the roclc on which
it was built. Triginta capitum prefigures the thirty years that are
to intervene between the founding oi Lavinium and the founding
of Alba

The object of Helenus was to point out the site oi the future city
merely, so that the verse beginning is locus urbis erit was essential
to his purpose; the object of Tiberinus, on the other hand, is to
interpret the prodigy, and in view of this purpose the verse beginning
hic locus urbis erit is superfluous it not confusing. For this reason
Conington brackets this verse, being further supported in so doing
by the fact that it is wanting in certain manuscripts.

47. ex quo: iiv. 46 be retained, sc. loco and translate: starting
out from this place (Lavinium). Ii v. 46 be rejected, which seems
preferable, sc. prodigio and translate: in conformity witi this portent.
