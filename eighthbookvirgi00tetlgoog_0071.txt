According to the common story, however, Hercules captured this
monster and brought him alive to Eurystheus. mactae: thou art
the slayer, etc. The present tense implies that the glory of the exÎ‡
ploit still lives and the memory oi it is loyally cherished by the
worshipers of the hero. Note the inspiring effect of the change
from the narrative form to the form of direct address.

295. Nemeae: the killing ot the lion that dwelt in a rocky cavern
in the valley of Nemea in Argolis and ravaged the neighbon'ng
country, was the first of 'the twelve labors oi Hercules.

296. The last ol the labors ot Hercules consisted in bringing
away the three-headed dog Cerberus who guarded the entrance to
the lower world (ianitor Orci). Cf. passage cited in teet-note.

298. ullae iacies Typhoeus: Typhoeus, a giant, son of
Earth and Tartarus was vanquished by Jupiter with the aid oi
Hercules and buried according to some accounts under Aetna, but
according to the story which Vergil follows under Inarime (mod.
Ischia), off the coast oi Campania. See IX. 716: Inarime Iovis
imperiis imposta Typhoeo. Itis usual with commentatore to refer
ullae iacies to monsters seen by Hercules when he visited Tartarus
to bring away Cerberus, and to include Typhoeus among them.
But this interpretation is obviously inconsistent with arduus arm
tenens and also with IX. 716 quoted above. We must suppose the
reference in non terruit ipse Typhoeus to be to the undaunted
courage with which Hercules came to the support oi Jupiter in his
conflict with the giant in the upper world. '

299. arduus: translate adverbially with tenens. For other
examples oi an adjective associated in this way with a participle, see
passages cited in footnote. rationis egentem: without resource.

300. Lernaeus anguis: it was one of the labore ot Hercules ro
kill the hydra of Lake Lerna in Argolis, a monster with seven heads
As fast as one oi these heads was struck off, two others appeared in
its place. Hercules, however, non rationis egene, killed the monster
by burning off the headS, a method which proved effectual and
final.

301. vera Iovis proles: as proved by the exploits just narrated.
decus: predicate after addite. Cf. IX. 485: canibus date praede
Latinis.

302. dexter adi: graciously draw m'gh.
