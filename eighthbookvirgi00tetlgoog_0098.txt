fied with Arcadian Pan. At the festival oi the Lupercalia, celebrated
on the fifteenth oi February, these priests ran through the streets of
Rome naked, except ior a strip oi goatskin about their loins, carry-
ing thongs of goatskin, with which they struck all who carne in their
way, especially women. This ceremony was symbolical oi a general
purification; cf. Ov. Fast. ΙΙ. 31-2: secta pelle Luperci omne solum
lustrant. Moreover‚ the touch oi the goatskin was supposed to
impart fertility to women.

The priests who were devoted to the service of a particular god were
called flamines: thus the stamen Dialis was the special priest oi
Jupiter. One of the characteristic features oi the dress
oi a flamen was the apex, which, properly speaking, was 1:159,

a small tapering piece oi olive wood encircled at the

bottom by a tillet oi wool (see annexed cut). This apex, ’
as usually worn, surmounted a close-fitting helmet-shaped
cap, so that cap and apex together resembled a peaked ᾗ

helmet, and the term apex was extended so as to ‘'
designate the entire head-novering. As the word flaminis
cannot be introduced into hexameter verse, the poet
designates thellamens by one oi the most characteristic features
of their official costume.

The foregoing paragraph embodies the interpretation usually given
to lanigeros apices. As the apex, how-
ever, was worn by the Salii as well as
by the flamens, it is quite possible that 'sc 1 ,

story was (see Ov. Fast. III. 365-92) *¹
that a shield had fallen from heaven in
the reign of Numa and that the su·

Numa, in order to prevent the shield from being stolen, had had
eleven others made exactly like it. The twelve shields were carefully
guarded by the Salii in the temple oi Mars. See annexed cut, rep

resenting Salii and ancilia.
