65. Here (i. e.‚ at the mouth of the river) is my spacions dwelling·

place (magna domus), my fanniam-head (caput) is among tlte lofty
citios (of Etruria). This seems to be the meaning oi this vexed Ι
passage. That Aeneas himself understands it so seems clear from
the language oi his address to Tiberinus (v. 75), where exis is
obviously used with the meaning here given to exit.

66-80. As tire river god disappears‚ Aeneas aeoakes. After eom·
mending himself to tire protection os fiather Tiber arrd the Laurention
Nympha andpledging himself to offer sacrifice to them in tiae future,
he prepares for tiae voyage.

66. deinde: regularly dissyllabic as here. lacu: channel.

⁶8. aetherii spectans orientia solis lumina: with eyes turned
towards tlte rising sun, witich roas now dffasing its light ooertne
sky (lit, the rising beams of the suu in the' sky). The worshiper‚
during his prayer, faces the east.

69. rite: the use of this word seems to imply that taking up
water from the river and holding it in the hollow of the hand was
a part oi the usual ceremonial observance connected with prayer to
a river god.

70. ad aethera: looking heavenwaral. Not only do the nympha
and river gods have homes in the fountains and rivers which are
under their guardianship‚ but they belong also to the celestial hie·
rarchy whose home is Olympus.

71. genus amnibus unde est: i. 0., the nymphs are the guardian
divinities of the springs in which the rivers take their rise.

72. Suggested by a similar line in Ennius: Teque poter Tiberine
tuo cum flumine sancto.

74. Quo ¹. . . cumque illustrates “ tmesis.’' Ι

74-5. lacus . . . fonte: according to Servius, lacus is the under-
ground reservoir, or pool, in which the waters that are to form the
river accumulate. Fons is the fountain-head at which the waters oi
this hidden reservoir well up and become visible. When the waters
thus issuing take up their onward tlow, they form the river. Trans-
late: wiereoerthe faunam-head may be of tire pool aoleern'n thou
dweIIest.

77. corniger: river gods are often represented with the head and
horna of a buil. See passages cited in root-note. Fluviuamsm.
