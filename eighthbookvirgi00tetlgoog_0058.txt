noras. 41

111. perculsus: for perculsus here instead of the usual reading
percussus, see Conington's note on 1. 513.

111. quicumque es: although Pallas knows that the strangers
are Trojans, he does not yet know the name of their leader.

12³· penatibus expresses both the heartiness of the welcome and
the divine sanction that accompanies and confirms it.

114. excepit manu, extended tis leand in melcoma

115. luco: here, as in v. 104, in preference to the appropriate
form of silva, because of the sacrifice which is taking place in the
wood.

116-151. Aeneas reminds Evander tltat tlte Τ rojam and tlte Arca-
drans are descended fram a conamen ancestar Atlas, and that they
have a common enemy in the Daunian racc. On nese grounds he
prcffirs ln's friendship and asks that of Evander in return.

117. cui: indirect object of precari. The dative of the person
to whom the prayer is addressed is irregular. Elsewhere the dative
expresses the person in whose behalf the prayer is offered. For an
example of the accusative, which is the regular construction, see

passage cited in foot·note; also v. 279: divos precantur. In the
present passage the construction is probably affected by praetendere.
· 118. Α branch of olive held in the ontstretched hand and some·
1111101, as here, wreathed with a fillet of wool (vitta comptos) signi-
fied that the bearer came with peaceful intent. Cf. passages cited
in font-note.

119. Danaum: the readers of the Aeneid were familiar with the Ι

Homeric use of Danai (properly the followers of Danaus, king of
Argos) as a general name for the Greeks. Below (Grai, v. 135)
Vergil uses a non-Homeric‚ but poetic, form in place of the ordinary
prose term Graeci.

130. ab stirpe coniunctus Atridis: Servius cites three different
explanations of the relationship. According to one of these, Aga·
memnon and Menelaus were descended from Dione, one of the
daughters of Atlas3 and Evander (as appears also from vv. 138—41)
was descended from Maia, another daughter of Atlas. fores = esses.
The subjunctive is dne to the fact that Aeneas asserts the common
descent of Evander and the Atridae not from his personal knowledge,
buton the authority of some legend known to himself and Evander,
- because, as tradition says, you are related, etc.
