norae. 57

several, are unsatisfactory. The allusion in this passage isto the
familiar tradition, reported by Livy (l. 8), according to which
Romulus peopled his new city by establishing on the Capit'oline
hill a refuge for the criminals and adventurers of the surrounding
districts.

343. Lupercal: a cave or grotta at the foot of the northern side
of the Palatine hill, sacred to the Italian shepherd divinity Lupercus,
who was identified with the Arcadian Pan. This, according to
tradition, was the place in which the she-wolf had suckled Romulus
and Remus.

⁶ 344. Parrhasio is equivalent to Arcadia, Parrhasia being a town
in Arcadia. Parrhasio - Lycaei: called Lycaean l'an's in imitation
af tire Arcadian curtam. According to Vergil, therefore, Lupercal,
the name ofthe grotta in the Palatino, is derived from lupus,
‘wolff just as Lycaeus, Pau’s sumame, is derived from λύκος, ‘wolf’
According to this etymology, the god owed his sumame to the fact
that he was the protector of the flocks of the shepherds from wolves.
Ovid, on the other hand, refers this surname to Mt. Lycaeus in
Arcadia (Fast3 II. 423-4).

345. Argileti: a district of uncertain situation in Rome. Vergil .
obviously interprets the name as meaning ‘the death of Argus’
(Argiletum). The tradition on which this etymology is founded
is thus given by Servius: Euander Argum quendam suscepit
hospitio. Qui cum de eius cogitaret interitu, ut ipse regnaret,
Euandro hac nan sentiente, socii intellexerunt et Argum necarunt:
cui Euander et sepulcrum fecit et lacum sacravit, nan quod ille
merebatur, sed hospitalitatis causa. The name probably comes,
however, from argilla, ‘white clay,’ and is due to the character ’
of the soil.

³4⁶· testatur locum, i. e., in protestation of his innocence of the
crime.

347. Tarpeiam sedem et capitolia. The Capitoline hill, down
to the time of Servius Tullius, was called Tarpeius mans, a name
which perpetuated and perhaps gave rise to the story of the tragic
fate of the Roman maiden Tarpeia (Liv. 1. 11). Capitolia is merely
explanatory of Tarpeiam sedem.

348. aurea nunc: in allusion to the rich gilding with which the
Capitol was omamented in the poet’s time: even the tiles on the

roof were gilded
