carrying torches in their hands. The feast is renewed, and tlze Salii,

280. Devexo Olympo: abl. abs. The celestial sphere is viewed

. as rotating daily from east to west on an axis passing through

the poles, thus presenting in alternate succession a diurnal and a
nocturnal hemisphere. At the approach oi evening‚ the diurna]

afterwards the priests of Pan at the Lupercalia flammas: torches.

283. mensae grata secundae dona does not, as the words might
seem to imply‚ refer to the dessert‚ or second course, following the

285. Salii: the Salii at Rome were an order of priests, twelve
in number, instituted according to popular tradition by Numa, aud
devoted to the service of Mars. At the annual festival of the god
in March, they carried in procession the twelve sacred shields
(ancilia) which were preserved in the temple of Mars. As they
went, they chanted songs in honoros the god and executed certain
rhythmic movements, which gave them the name of Salii (snb, kap),
the leaping or dancing priests (see cut annexed to note on v. 664).
At Tibur moreover, and perhaps at Rome, there seem to have been
Salii oi Hercules also, whose riteS, as the present passage shows,
were similar to those performed by the Salii of Mars. They took
no part in the sacrifice proper, but chanted hymns, to the accom-
paniment of rhythmic movements, in honor of Hercules. ad cantus
expresses the purpose of adsunt.

288-9. The first exploit ot Hercules was the strangling of the
serpents sent by Juno to destroy him in his cradle.

288. prima, in ln's iufirucy, agrees oi course with monstra, but
isbest translated adverbially. novercae: Hercules was the son ot
Jupiter by Alcmene; novercae is therefore here used purposely to
show that jealousy was the inspiring motivo ot Juno’s persecutione.
