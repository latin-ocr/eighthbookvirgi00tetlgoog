665. ducebant sacra: tuere advancing in solemn processioa. Cf.
passage cited in font-note. Such processions were instituted in
honor of Ceres and Carmentis.

666. pilentis mollibus: cuslioned carriages, or perhaps, according
to Servius's interpretation of mollibus, swaying carriages. When
after the capture of Veii, 396 Β. c, the money in the treasury was
found insufficient for the offering to Apollo which Camillus had
vowed to make, the Roman matrons made good the deficiency by
sacrificing their personal ornaments. In recognition of their public
spirit, the senate rewarded them with the privilege of riding in car·
riages in certain sacred processions (Liv. V. 25).

667-70. The religious institutions just mentioned 'naturally enough
suggest the punishments and rewards which await mankind in the
underworld after death. Accordingly, at some distance from the
foregoing scenes, we have a threefold picture. The first part repre·
sents the entrance to the underworld (v. 667), the second the punish-
ments of the yvicked (vv. 668-9), and the third the rewards of the
blest (v. 670). Catiline is made the type of those who are punished
for attempting to destrqy the liberties of their country, Cato of those
who are rewarded for endeavoring to preserve them.

669. pendentem scopulo: the punishment here assigned to Cat·
iline seems to have been suggested by that assigned to Prometheus
in the Greek mythology. Prometheus, for defying the will of Zeus,
was chained to a rock on Mt. Caucasus, where a vulture continually
devoured his liver, which was perpetually renewed. ln' place of the
vulture, we have the furies (Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone).

670. dantem iura: imposing lawr, exercising authority. catonem:
the reference is to the younger Cato, or Cato Uticensis. Vergil has
been accused of inconsistency in making Cato‚a suicide, the law-
giver of the blest in Elysium, after having, in the sixth book, con-
signed suicides to a place of suffering. But in the sixth book the
poet has in mind not those who, like Cato, have relinquished their
lives in the spirit of patriotism, but those qui lucem perosi proiecere
animas. To the poets of the Augustan age the suicide of Cato was
a glorious death. Cf. Hor. Carm. 1. 12, 35: Catonis nobile letum.
Moreover, in making Cato the lawgiver of the blest in Elysium,
Vergil doubtless had in mind Cato's character and the whole tenor
of his life rather than the manner of his death. On this point, cf.
Sall. Cat. LIV. 5.
