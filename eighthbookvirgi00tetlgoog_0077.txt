ol interdum, ‘at times! Cf. V. 12 sc: [saxum] tumidis submersum
tunditur olim fluctibus, hiberni condunt ubi sidera Cori.

391·2· tonitru. . . rupta . . . ignea rima: grammatically tonitru
Is to be construed as an abl. oi means with rupta (rent by the
thunder psall, corusco goes with lumine, and rupta belongs to
ignea rima. Strictly speaking, oi course, it is the cloud, and not
the riit (rima), that is rent asunder‚ and the thunder is the effect,
not the cause, oi the lightning. The Aeneid is a poetical composi-
tion, not a scientific treatise.

395. quid causas petis ex alto: whygo so sar in search os argu·
ments? cunctantem, v. 338, seems to give a sufficient answer to
this question.

396. tibi (ethical dat.) . . . mei: these words have a touch ol
tender reproachfulness. diva: my queen (Conington).

396-7. fuisset . . . fuisset: the repetition oi this word at the end
of the verse gives prominence to the condition and marks the con·
clusion as sure oi iulfillment.

397. tum quoque indicates the time referred to by Venus in
VV· 374-7·

398. nec fata vetabant: the decrees of fate are sure of iulfill·
ment, but the time of their iulfillment is subject to change Cf.
VII. 313-15.

Non dabitur regnis, esto, prohibere Latinis,

atque immota mann satz's Lavinia comm:
ai trahere atque rnoras tantis licei addere rebus.

399· decern alios per anno's is to be taken with sture as well ,as
with superesse. Servius quotes certain Etruscan books of divi-
nation as authority for the statement that the fulfillment oi the
decrees off ate might be delayed ten years

401- 3. The passage beginning with quidquid and ending with
valent illustrates‘ anacoluthon! After valent we should expect id
obi promitto ; but at this point Vulcan, overcome by the blandish·
ments oi Venus, involuntarily drops the language oi solemn assur·
ance and ends with a gush oi feeling.

402. electro: according to Pliny, a metal composed of three
parts oi gold and one of silver.

403. ignes animaeque: fircs of the sorge and blatis from ihc
bt'llows.
