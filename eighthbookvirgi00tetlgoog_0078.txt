noras 61

428-67, where Thetis asks Hephaestus to lorge new armor lor
Achilles in place of that which the latter has lent to Patroclus and
which Patroclus has lost; and from ll. XIV. api-3 51, where llera
by her blandishments lures Zeus to slumber in order that Poseidon,
taking advantage of his absence, may lead the Greeks to victory.
Both passages in the Iliad seem natural because they are adequately
explained by what precedes and follows the' action described3
whereas, in the passage before uS, there is imitation merely, without
adequate motive. As Heyne justly remarks, Venus’s application to
Vulcan for armor ot divine workmanship would seem more natural
and appropriate if the passage in which the splendid armor of
Aeneas's rival Turnus is described (XII. 87-100l had preceded.
The need of divinely wrought armor would then be more apparent.

407-53. Soon after midnight Vulcan proceeds to a covern, beracoth
one of the Aeolion islanda, where lu's gaunt workmen, tlte Cyclopes,
are forging thunderbolts sor Jupiter, o coar-choriotfor Mars, ond tlte
aegis for Pallas. At the command of the god, thoy ot once lay asida
these tasks andproceed to sorge a skiolrl sor Aeneas.

407-8. ubi prima quies expulerat: the prose expression would
be: ubi primum quiss expulzt. The pluperfect expulerat, though
emphasizing the completeness of the action, is here due mainly to
the exigencies ot the metre. noctis abactae: tlze fleetioo night (lit,
night drawn away). Night is thought of as drawn in a chariot by
the Hours (ct. passage cited in foot-note). The ab· in abactae ψ
implies that mid-heaven has already been reached and passed, and
that the chariot of N ight is now descending‚ i. e., departing from the
sky. In other words, the time indicated is between midnight and
daybrealr. curriculo is an abl. of time.

408. cum femina primum. . . suscitat marks more exactly the
time already indicated by ubi prima quies expulerat somnum.

4⁰9· tenui Minerva, added in explanation of colo, refers not to
the delicate texture of the fabric wrought, but to the slender income
obtainable from the household arts of spinning and weaving. On
the use of Minerva to designate the arts over which the goddess
presides, cf. passages cited in footnote.

409-10. cui lmpositum (sc. est) = cui necesse est.

41⁴0. cinerem. . . ignis: repeated from V. 743.
