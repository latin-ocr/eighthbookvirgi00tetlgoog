riorus, 79

Tullus Hostilius, had proposed the combat between the Curiatii and
the Horatii as a means of settling the question of supremacy in
dispute between the Albans and the Romans. When the defeat of
the Curiatii had established the supremacy of Rome, the Albans were
called upon to aid the Romans against the inhabitants of Veii and
Fidenae. In the battle which followed, however, Mettus, the Alban
general, deserted the Romans at the critical moment and withdrew
his forces to a neighboring hill. On the following day he was pun-
ished for his treachery in the manner described in the text. See Liv.
