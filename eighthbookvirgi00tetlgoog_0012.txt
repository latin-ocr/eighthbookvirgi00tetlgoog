PREFACE. V

The vocabulary, in addition to etymological matter and

occasional observations on the limited use of exceptional
words, giveS, first, the original meaning of each word,
and then, in the order of their development, the several
meanings in which the word is used in the text, together
with copious and, in important cases, exhaustive refer·
ences by number to the verses in which these meanings
occur.

The edition intended for use in sight reading retains
the classified word groups referred to in the foregoing
paragraph, but omits the general vocabulary3 in other
respects it is identical with the edition prepared for
ordinary use.

The ability to detect‚ under whatever additions or dis-
guiseS, the common element in a group of related words
is so valuable in itself and so essential to facility in
reading a foreign language, that any device by which the
habit of looking for evidence of relationship may be
developed and aptness in recognizing such evidence
strengthened‚ is an important addition to the apparatus
of instruction. The word groups which precede the
general vocabulary have been prepared with special refer-
ence to the development of this power. They do not
contain all the words or all the groups for which the text
of the eighth book affords material. The aim has been
practica] utility rather than theoretical exhaustiveness
Such labor, therefore, as may be involved in mastering
them, will, it is believed, be rewarded by increased facility
in reading.
