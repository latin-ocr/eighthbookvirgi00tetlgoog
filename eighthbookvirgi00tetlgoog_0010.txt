PREFACE.

Trrs advisability of including selections from the later
‘ books of the Aeneid in the reading even of classes that
are to translate not more than six books of the poem,
will hardly be questioned. The difference in character
between the first six books and the last six is marked,
and has often been pointed out; the former, as a story
oi adventure, being compared to the Odyssey‚ and the
latter, as a narrative of war and conquest, to the lliad.
Some acquaintance with the second half oi the poem is
obviously essential to an adequate appreciation oi the
poem as a whole. Again, that part of the Aeneid which
deals with Italy and the subjugation of the native races
has quite as important a bearing on the main purpose of
the poem —the celebration oi the origin and historic
career oi the Roman nation —as that which has to do
with the iate oi Troy and the wanderings oi Aeneas.
Perhaps, too, not the least significant of the reasons
which might be urged in favor of an occasional excursion
into the field oi the later books is to be iound in the
fact that such excursions afford relief to the teacher from
the monotony of carrying successive classes, year aiter
year, over exactly the same ground, while they give to his
work a positive zest which is sure to react with happy
effect on his pupils.
