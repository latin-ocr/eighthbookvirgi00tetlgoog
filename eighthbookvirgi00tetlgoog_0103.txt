697. anguis: in allusion to the report that Cleopatra finally
brought about her own death by the bite of an asp. We may sup
pose that Vergil followed some version of the story in which two
serpents were mentioned, or that ‘twin serpents’ were used by him,
as in the case of Laocoon (ll. 203-5), for pictorial effect.

698. deum monstra: the Egyptian gods were represented with
the heads oi beasts. latrator: Anubis was represented with the
head oiadog. .

701. tristes ex aethere Dirae: the furies are represented in the

704. Actius Apollo: Apollo had a temple on the promontory of
Actium. Augustus, in commemoration oi his victory over Antony

the fleet of Antony‚ which lay in lull view below. eo terrore: in

708. immittere funis: let ozct the sheets, i. e., let the topos, which
held the sail by its two lower corners to the sides of the vessel‚ run
out, so that the wind might fill the sail vand drive the ship forward.
laxos is used proleptically, the effect of letting the sheets (funis)
run out (immittere) being to make them slack (laxos). iam
iamque: more and more. Not that the ‘more and more’ could be
seen in the picture, but the bellying of the sail and the stretching of
the sheet were so life-like that the ‘more and more' was suggested
to the imagination of the spectator.
