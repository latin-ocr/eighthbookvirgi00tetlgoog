iv paemen.

⁰ Of the later books of the Aeneid, none is better fitted
¹to engage the pupil’s attention than the eighth. The
exceptional freedom of the text from doubtful readings,
the interest with which the characters, both leading and
minor, are invested, the charm oi the story, the wealth
ψ of mythological and historical allusion, and the significant
relation which this part of the poem bears to the general
plan of the whole, combine to give this booka special
claim to¹ recognition. The story oi Hercules and Cacus
puts into concrete form the traditions current in the
poet’s time of the barbarism which characterized pre-
historic Italy; Evander, the hero oi the book, is the
most gracious personality in the entire poem, - worthy‚
as the type of knightly courtesy, simple dignity, and
manly fortitude, oi a place beside Sir Guyon of the Faery
Queene; the shield of Aeneas, with its prophetie pictures
oi scenes and characters from legendary and contem·
poraneous history, carries the reader into the very heart
of Roman life and thought and aspiration, revealing the
source and embodying the spirit of Roman nationality
and patriotism.

The present work, which contains the eighth book of
the Aeneid, is issued in two editionS, one ior use in the
ordinary way, the other for use in sight reading.

The edition prepared for ordinary use contains: an
introductory outline of the story oi the first seven books
of the Aeneid3 the textos the eighth book accompanied
by illustrative citations, in the form of footnoteS‚ of in-
structive passages from Vergil and occasionally from
other Latin authors ; notes to aid the pupil in interpreting
the text3 classified groups of words of kindred etymology
taken from the text3 and, finally, a general vocabulary.
