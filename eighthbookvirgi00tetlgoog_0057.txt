Alcmene; but‘Amphitryon, being the husband of Alcmene, was the
reputed father ot Hercules. The use of the patronymic is a neces-
sity here because Herculi (— υ —l cannot form part of a hexameter
verse. divisque: and (through him) to the gods. It was customary
when a sacrifice was offered to a particular divinity to include, in a
secondary way, the other divinities whose favor or kindly interest
merited grateful recognition. Cf. the passage cited in the root-note,
which the present passage recalls.

1o4. 'Some commentators consider huic una a poetic locution
equivalent to una cum hoc and refer huic to Evander. So Coning-
ton, who compares the dative with una to the dative with similis
and parr'tcr. It seems preferable, however, to make huic refer to
Amphitryoniadae and to construe it with tura dabant.

105. iuvenum: i. e., those who are oi military age. iuvenum is
here contrasted with senatur, the council oi elders. pauper: the
unambitious poverty of an earlier age and the simplicity and incor-
ruptibility supposed to accompany it are a frequent subject of com-
mendation with the poets.

106. cruor: blood freshly shed3 sanguis, blood circulating in the
body.

107. videre is construed first with the acc. (rates) and afterwards
with the acc'. and infin. (adlabi and incumbere). So miratur (v. 92)
with scuta and innare carinas (v. 93).

108. tacitis remis: grammatically rates is the subject of incum-
bere and tacitis agrees with remis; but it was the rowers, of course,
who plied the oars and refrained from speech. There is another
reading tacitos, which gives a simpler construction and expresses
more directly the meaning intended. But here, as usually, the more
difficult reading, as offering the greater temptation to alteration at
the hands oi a mechanical transcribet because of its supposed ob
scurity, is the one to be accepted. tacitos probably crept into the
text from some marginal interpretation.

110. mensis: a banquet formed a part of the sacrificial ob

servance. Cf. passage cited in footnote. rumpere: to interrupta
sacrifice was an act of impiety, which might be attended with evil
consequences.

114. genus: acc. of specification. Cf. V. 285: Cressa genus,
Pholoe.

117. inimica Latiale: v. 5 5 shows that this announcement would
open the way to a friendly reception of the Trojans.
