noras 47

τοι. tergemini Geryonae: Geryones or Geryon (Vergil uses both
forms), a giant monster having three heads and a threefold trunk,
was king of the island of Erythia, off the west coast oi Spain near
Gades. It was one ot the labors of Hercules to slay this monster
and bring away his magnificent herds oi cattle. Having performed
this exploit, he was now returning from Spain by way of Italy. Cf.
passage cited in soor-note.

203. Alcides: Hercules was the grandson ol Alceus. The un·
manageableness of the name Hercules in hexameter verse and the
consequent necessity of having recourse to patronymics, has already
been pointed out (see note on v. 103).

²05· furiis: stendislz passion. caci mens effera: grammatically
mens is the subject of avertit (v. 208). The explanation of the
logical absurdity involved is that, when the poet reached v. 208, he
had the irenzied Cacus in his mind and proceeded' as if he had
written in v. 205 Cacus mentem afferatus.

20⁶. fuisset: the pluperfect tense is due to the fact that Evander
isindirectly quoting in his narration the thoughts of Cacus. Cacus
is presumed to have soliloquized thus: “li I do not commit this
wanton outrage, I shall have left (lut. perf.) some torm of villainy
unpractised.”

207. stabulis: not ‘stalls’ in the ordinary sense, but fieding
grounds in the valley by the river (see v. 204).

208. forma superante: of surpassing or incomparable bcauty.
Usually the participle, when used adjectively, ends in ‘i'; why not
here? ⁴

209. pedibus rectis: abl. oi description with vestigia, tracks
with the fect pointing fonoard, i. e.‚ to the cave of Cacus.

aro-11. versis viarum indiciis: wz'tlz fhotpn'nts reversed. indiciis
riarum is only another expression ior vestigiis already used in the
preceding verse. wuda ...tractos . . . raptos saxo occultabat
opaco: dragging them by the tail ond huroying them along, he oster·
words kept them in ln'ding in his rocky cavero. A conjectural read-
ing raptor ior raptos, suggested by Wakefield -and adopted by
Ribbeck, improves this passage.

212. quaerenti: a dat. used absolutely, if any one should come
to seek them. Cf. egressis in passage cited in footnote.

ars-6. The infinitives are historical. The lowing ot the cattle
heard at the moment of departure (discessu), again as theu pass
