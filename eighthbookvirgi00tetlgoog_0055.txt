38 Ι nores. .

writers, use the nominative ior the vocative when they wish to give
dignity or solemnity tb the expression. Cf. Liv. Ι. 24, 7: Audi tu,
populus Albanus.

78. propius: ruore manifestly, i. e.'; by some physical manifesta-
tion‚ some visible sign. numina may here be taken as equivalent to
ominu; see passage cited in foot-note. This prayer is answered
vv. 81-3.

80. Almost identical with III. 471.

81-101. Suddeuly a white saw with a litter uf white young appears
on the shore. These animus Aeneas effers in sacrifice to Juno, and
at nightfall proceeds with his campaninus up the river. The Tiber
checks the eriward flow of his waters, so that the rurs meet with
no resista'nce. All night long the T rcy'ans pursue their way between
the bunhs, and by noun of the following day they reach the city eff
Euander.

81. oculis: abl. cf. X. 637: vesu mirabile monstrum.

82. candida per silvam: gleaming through the trees ; ci. v. 43.

83. procubuit: present perfect; not (like procubuit, v. 30)
historical perfect. The meaning⁴ is ‘has lain’ and therefore ‘is
lying‚' so that procubuit with conspicitur is equivalent to pro·
cumbens conspicitur. sus: a monosyllable at the end oi the verse
· is, generally speaking, a metrica] blemish; but, like apermissible
discord in music, it is ior that very reason well adapted to arroet
the attention and produce a striking effect. Thus the effect may
be sublime and impressive, asin G. Ι. 247: intempesta silet nox, and
in Ι. 105: insequitur cumulo praeruptus aquae mons; ludimus, as
in Hor. A. Ρ. 139: Parturr'unt monetes, nascetur ridiculus mun
imitative, as in V. 481: Sternitur exanimisque tremens procumbit
humi bos; or, as in the present passage, momentous and significant.

84. enim strengthens tibi: yes, to thee. Perhaps it implies that
Aeneas, in uttering tibi . . . Iuno, is reminded oi the injunction of
Helenus in ΙΙΙ. 437—9, which heis now about to carry into effect.

85. curn grege: with her whole litter. As the stationing of the
animals before the altar precedes the slaughtering, there is an
apparent inversion here in the order of the clauses; but it is ap·
parent only. The emphasis in the second clause lies on cum grege,
so that this clause merely adds the statement that the luter tonia
included in the sacrifice.
