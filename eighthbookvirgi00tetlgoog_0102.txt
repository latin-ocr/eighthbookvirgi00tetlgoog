for action. credas: cf.

693. tanta mole, with such straining effort, i. e.‚ with such resist-
less force, is an adverbial expression limiting instant, not an ablative
oi description limiting puppibus. Cf. nzolis in passage cited in foot-
note. turritis puppibus: Servius ascribes to Agrippa the invention
of towers which, though out of sight under ordinary circumstances,
could be suddenly raised from the deck in time oi action. Cf. '
passage cited in leot-note. '

694. stuppea flamma: burning tow. The reference is to the
malleolus, a sort offiredart shaped like a hammer. The head, ,⁵

which was filled with pitch and tow, was set on fire before the missile : s

was launched from the hand; and, continuing to burn during its
passage through the air, it, set on fire the object on which it alighted.
telis = telorum tectu. volatile ferrum spargitur = in omnes partes
volat ferrum. This, which is Wagner's interpretation, seems to be
the best explanation oi this vexed passage. The line may be ireely
translated: showers offire-dorts are launched from the harad, and
the frequent ‘discharge of sbvelins fills tlte air in
all directions wt'th flying steel.

much used by the Egyptians in celebrating the rites ff ’ᾗ ”,
oi Isis (see annexed cut). It is here introduced ⁸
in a spirit oi irony. Cleopatra, essaying to infuse a
martial spirit into her followers b'y shaking the
Egyptian rattle‚ was a fitting ioil to the stately
Augustus pictured in vv. 678-81. Propertius says
ol Cleopatra (Ill. 11‚43): ausa Romanam tubam
crtstdanli pellere restro.
