42 noras,

131. mea virtus: conscious merit, my just descrts. The com·
mentators are inclined to apologize for Aeneas’s seli-laudation here;
but the expression hardly means more than the modern phrase
‘confident in the justice of my cause! At all events, a generation
of readers who could admire Cicero’s orations would probably not
think mea virtus extravagant selfcommendation. For an instance
more offensive to modern taste, cf. I. 378: Sum pius Aeneas . ..
firma super aethera notus.

132. cognati patres: explained below, vv. 134·14²·

134. According to tradition, Dardanus went from Corythus in
Etruria first to Samothrace, and afterwards to Asia Minor (VII.
206-9). Ilium was built, however, not by Dardanus, but by llus,
his descendant, from whom also it received its name. Ilus was
fourth in descent from Dardanus the order of succession being as
follows: 1. Dardanus (son of Jupiter aud Electra), 2. Erichthonius
(son of Dardanus), 3. Tros (son of Erichthonius), 4. llus (son-of
Tros). Dardanus, therefore, is only indirectly Iliacae urbis auctor.

135. ut Grai perhibent: this would serve to commend the
genealogy to Evander, himself a Greek. cretus: poetic for ortus.
For the construction. cf. sata gente (v. 36) and nate dea (v. 59).
. Atlantide anticipates the formal statement of the descent from Atlas
given in vv. 136-7. The repetition shows the importance which
Aeneas wishes Evander to attach to their common descent from
Atlas.

136. advehitur Teucros = advehitur orl Teucros. The preposition
is often omitted in poetry before the accusative construed with a
verb of motion. Cf. Ι. 2: Italiam venit, and VII. 216-7: urbem
adferimur.

138. candida: brr'glzt. Maia was the brightest star in the con-
stellation Pleiades. Some of the commentators prefer to see no
reference here to Maia’s brightness as a star, and translate candida
fair, asin candida Dido, V. 571. ’ ’

141. generat: is tlte firtlrer <fi illustrates a peculiar use of the
present tense in verbs expressing birth, which does not appear in
Latin literature until the Augustan age. caeli sidera = aetherios
orbis, v. 137. tullit=sustinen The repetition in v. 141 again illus·
trates the importance attached to the common descent from Atlas.

143. The preposition per belongs to legatos as well as to artem
