541.elto here, as in v. 461, is hardly consistent with parvos
Penates-(v. 543), angusti tecti (v. 366), and humili tecto (v. 455).
The dignified bearing, courtly manners and noble qualities of mind
and heart with which Vergil has invested Evander's gracious person-
ality seem occasionally to have triumphed over the poet's art and to
have won ior themselves at his hands a corresponding theatre of
action.

542. primum correlates with post (v. 546), which is here equiv-
alent to deinde. Herculeis ignibus = ignibus ex Herculis ara
sumptis. On the preceding day Evander had offered sacrifice in
honor oi Hercules at the Ara Maxima in a grove outside the city
(cf. vv. roz-4 and vv. 271-2). We are to suppose that, at the close
oi that sacrifice, Evander had brought and placed on his domestic
altar some oi the embers oi the sacred fire that had been kindled in
honor oi the god. The sign which has just been vouchsafed from
heaven prompts the reverent Aeneas to renew the service oi sacrifice.
In the present instance the sacrifice is made on the domestic altar, ’

. end presumably to the Penates worshiped by Evander. Among
these, Hercules would naturally hold a prominent place. So in
Sicily Aeneas had offered sacrifice to the Penates worshiped by
Acestes. Cf. V. 62—3: adhibete Penatis et patrios epulis et quos culti! ,¹
hospes Acestes. sopitas ignibus aras excitat, a poetic expression
ior agnes sopitos in aris excitat, illustrates both the ‘transferred
-epithet’ (sopitas being used with eras instead of with ignibus) and
‘hypallage’ (ignibus aras excitat being used for ignes in aris
