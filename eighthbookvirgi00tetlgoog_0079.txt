62 nores.

411. ad lumina: i. e.,'by the light of the fire.

413. educere: of the two words edficdre and eddcire, the former.
properly refers, as here, to physical nurture, the latter to mental
training, though the distinction is not uniformly observed.

408-13. On this passage, cf. for the general spirit, as well as for
details, the description oi the ‘virtuous woman' in Proverbs, XXXI.
10-31.

414. haud secus: as if veluti cum had preceded. The active
energy oi the thrifty housewife, which at v. 408 was introduced
merely as a means of defining with greater precision the time of
Vulcan’s rising from his couch, is here made the basis of a formal
comparison. The point of the comparison is the alacrity with which
physica] ease and comfort are relinquished at the call oi duty.

416-7. Aeoliam Liparen: Lipare or Lipara, the modern Lipari,
is one of the Aeolian islands off the northern coast oi Sicily. It
was supposed by the ancients to be the island assigned by Homer to
King Aeolus, the custodian of the winds. cf. Ι. 50 ff. The par·
ticular island beneath which the forges of the Cyclopes were set up
seems to be left purposely without a name by the poet. Later
(v. 422) he gives it the general designation Volcania nomine tellus;
and, as Hiera, which is a small island lying to the south oi Lipara,
was called by the Romans Volcani insula, it has been generally
assumed that Vergil had Hiera in mind.

417. erigitur = surgit with the added notion that the island is
rocky.

418-9. specus: the main cave; antra: reeesses within the cave
carved out of the solid rock to receive the forges of the Cyclopes.
caminis, dat, = ad usum caminorum. Others take caminis as an
ablative ot means with exesa, and consider that the antra are repre·
sented as hollowed out by the action of lire: how forges could be
set up and fires kindled on thern before the antra existed, they do
not explain.

419. Aetnaea: like those of Aetna, i. e, vomiting dre and smoke.
incudibus: loc. abl.

421. stricturae Chalybum: masses of iron like those wrought by
the Chalybes. The Chalybes were a people of Pontus famous as
miners and workers in iron. anhelat: the panting sound is pro·

ξυεεά by successive blasts of air driven through the luel by the
ellows.
